Beginner Node.js Command Line Application

This app retrieves information from the teamtreehouse API, parses the data, and prints it out. It demonstrates an ability to handle errors, implement event handlers for streams and organize code in modules.

Stretch Goals:
1. Give friendly error messages when the connection fails, or when there's a parse error.
1. Make the argument passed after the app.js to be the top carrier you want to know how many points a Treehouse student has in the area.
1. Extract all the printing methods out into its own module, named something like printer.
